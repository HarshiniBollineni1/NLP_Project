Fake News Detection Using Python

Abstract:
The proliferation of fake news in the age of social media has raised grave concerns, impacting public opinion, elections, and inciting violence. Machine learning models, such as the Passive Aggressive Classifier and LSTM, combined with natural language processing, offer promising solutions for fake news detection. However, ongoing research is essential to enhance accuracy and address the complexity of this problem. This study provides insights into the use of these models while recognizing the multifaceted nature of fake news detection, requiring continued exploration and development.
